### SASPACer ###

This is a package for easily creating SAS packages.

All you need is to fill package information in the template excel 
(you can find it in additional contents).
`SASPACer` has a macro(`%ex2pac()`) to convert excel with package information into
SAS package folders and files, and generate SAS package using the `%generatePackage()`
macro (the generation is optional but executed by default).

macro(`%pac2ex()`) can convert package zip file into excel file with package information as well.

list of macros:  
- `%ex2pac()`  
- `%pac2ex()`

## `%ex2pac()` macro <a name="ex2pac-macros-1"></a> ######

`%ex2pac` is a macro to convert excel with package information into
SAS package folders and files.

### Parameters
	- `excel_file` : full path for excel file which contains package information

	- `package_location` : location where package files to be stored.
		                     Subfolder named package name will be created 
                             under the location.

	- `complete_generation` (default=Y) : If user want to create only package structure, 
                                        please change complete_generation=N.
		                                By default, `%ex2pac` execute `%generatePackage()` 
                                        to create .zip and .md.


### Excel file to read

	Easy to understand the structure. Take a look anyway.
	In sheets like macros, the `%ex2pac` uses body information if body column is filled,
	while refers file in location column if body column is blank.
	(This is a situation where macros(or other files) were already created somewhere in a file and
	would like to use it instead of copying contents in body column of the excel.)


### Flow of the `%ex2pac` macro
	1. Create package subfolder in the location.
		Name of the subfolder will be set as the package name.
	2. Create description.sas
	3. Create license.sas
	4. Create subfolders like 01_formats, 02_functions, etc. in reference to
		the excel sheet names.
	5. Create sas files based on information described in each excel sheet
	6. Run %generatePackages()

### Sample code

~~~sas
%ex2pac(
	excel_file=C:\Temp\template_package.xlsx,
	package_location=C:\Temp\SAS_PACKAGES\packages,
	complete_generation=Y)
~~~

### Note:
  1. `%ex2pac` expects the operating system to be either Windows or a non-Windows environment
  (such as Linux, Unix, etc.). The `&SYSSCP` macro variable is used to identify the current OS.
  Only tested in Windows.

  2. Libref named `e2p_xls` is used in the macro.
  3. Max length of 32767 bytes is the limit in both cells in excel and reference file(.sas) in location column
  due to limitations in excel cell max length and max length of SAS variables used in the macro.
